# STOR 538 - Sports Analytics: Playoff 2
Here is the work and results related to the second project I completed as part of STOR 538 during the spring semester of 2023 at UNC Chapel Hill.

## Description
For this project, we were tasked with gathering data on the spread, total points, and offensive rebounds for NBA games, and using this data to build machine learning models capable of predicting these statistics for future games.

## Results
The final results of the project are showcased in the final project writeup file, found at [STOR P2 Writeup.pdf](https://github.com/westonmurdock23/stor538-playoff2/blob/d96e4a28d93072afe9e63ca11d0384a10a4735fe/STOR%20P2%20Writeup.pdf)
